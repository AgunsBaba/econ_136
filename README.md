# Deep Learning for Timeseries - MLADS
This repository includes materials a tutorial part of **Demystifying Deep Learning**

## 1. Getting Started
1. Download or clone the files in the repository to your local machine. (Green button top right). You specfically need the 3 files in the MLADS folder.
2. Decide if you want to run locally (step 2), or run online Jupyter notebook (DSVM). 

## 2. Installing and Running Locally
### Requirements
Pandas, Tensorflow >= 1.4, Numpy

Everything should be pip installable. 
### Run
To run a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) simply run the command: ```jupyter notebook pres_election_2016.ipynb```

A [Jupyter Notebook (IPython Kernel)](http://jupyter.org/) is a web based interactive compute environment featuring [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop). This makes iterative learning quick and easy!

## 3. Running Online
The suggested environment is a [Data Science Virtual Machine](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-machines/data-science-virtual-machines/). This pre-configured environment will come pre-installed with libraries like Tensorflow and others and be optimized for GPU usage. This will save considerable time. 
1. Configuration Details here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/data-science-virtual-machine/dsvm-ubuntu-intro
2. Upload the notebook or download it from inside the VM.
